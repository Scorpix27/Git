<h2 id="What">What Is Version Control System</h2>
<p>What is Version Control System (VCS)? VCS are a category of software tools that help software engineers manage changes
    to files over a period of time. Every little change that is made in files such as a period, an extra word, or paragraphs 
    are tracked in a database. If a file becomes corrupt or get accidently deleted, a programmer can recall the last modified
     version of the file from the VCS database and continue on with their work. One of the features to VCS is that you can alter a 
     a file without affecting the rest of a project that your team is working on. For instance, if I wanted to make correction to 
     a picture on the index page, I can "pull" the file from the database and make the correction, even though someone else on my
     team are adding text to that same index. A good VCS will not file block you if someone else is already in that file.

<p> What is Git? Git is one of the most popular VCS that was created by Linus Torvalds during the development of Linux Kernel
    (Linux Operating System) Git is a free software that is used for tracking file changes and has a backup history of all
    changes made. Like most VCS, it has the ability to have multiple users make corrections to a file simultaneously. The image on the left
    shows how Git's opening main page looks. The file pathway is linked to a folder where the HTML coding will be stored.

<h2 id="Why">Why Use Git?</h2><img id="right" src="all.png"alt "changes" width="464" height="324">
<p>Git, just like other VCS help maintain and keep track of files and their correction history so that if anything goes wrong,
    you can recall the latest modified file and restore it. This is very important if your new to any type of coding development.
    Say your working with C++ or HTML codes and you spent hours on a project. You then go and test it but it doesn't verify and 
    there's bugs in it. You knew that yesterday it worked fine, but can't seem to remember what or how much you added to it today. 
    You can go into Git and recall the last committed file and review that instead. Or maybe you wanted to work on styles of a website
    but your co-worker wanted to add more text or pictures at the same time. Git lets you and your co-worker work on the same file 
    without any interruptions. With Git, there's no waiting for someone to finish their part on a project so you can start yours.
    The picture to the right shows all the files that have been staged and ready to be "commited" to the repository folder. Once
    a file has been committed, it is stored in the history. You can modify the same file and commit it, but it will not over write the
    first file committed.<br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="Who">Who Uses Git?</h2><img id="opn" src="changes.png"alt "changes" width="825" height="229">
<p>Git, and other VCS are used widely throughout software coders. GitHub which is based off of the software Git, is in the top 100
    most popular sites. Git and GitHub is an open source software that as stated above, allows multiple users access to file editing
    without interfering with others working on the same file. Companies like Google and Microsoft use Git and GitHub for their code editing.
    Websites like Facebook, Amazon, Yahoo, and Apple use Git. The picture on the left demonstrates why many companies use this software.
    When you type "git status" it shows what files have been modified. This lets other people on a team know that a file has been changed. 
    When you pull a file from the repository, it will have a comment section for coders to put notes on what they changed.<br><br>
</p>
<h2 id="Can">Can I Become an Expert in Git?</h2>
<p>Git is a very powerful VCS that works off of commands. Though the basics of Git can be taught in just a few hours, the full understanding
    of Git can turn into a full course semester. You can also buy a book called "Git Complete: The definitive, step-by-step guide to Git"
    created by Jason Taylor, who composes 84 lectures on working with Git.
</p>
<h2 id="My">My Thoughts on Git</h2>
<p>When I started learning this software, I thought it was pretty easy to learn. I thought the outside surface of this software seemed a bit
    tedious and drawn out. After watching a few tutorial videos and reading more about this software, I realized that it has a lot to offer than
    just backing up files. You have complete control over them. When you take a snapshot of the your file and save it, you have the option to
    add comments on what you updated in that file. You can document every change so that when you pull that file again, you can review that you did
    last time you modified that file.
    That being said, I only really find this and all other VCS being useful if your working in a team or group where everyone would have their fingers
    in a project like web design or game development. In those situations, it's easier to have it on a remote repository where everyone can do their
    part without waiting for someone to finish their first. I did find that working on my final webpage, using Git became a bit tiresome. Every change 
    I made, I had to go into Git and commit the file to the local respository so it was backed up. This is something I could and that I do with a thumb drive.
    If I plan on going into web development or gaming company, I would further my knowledge of this software as I feel it would help more so 
    working with larger groups or teams. But for just me building or designing websites, I probably wouldn't use it.
